# Metatile Generator

The Metatile Generator is a tool to help with the creation of metatiles from standard tiles. Metatiles are a technique when creating a videogame tileset that allows you to draw a small set of tiles (6) where two materials meet (such as grass and dirt). in a specific pattern. Those tiles can then be divided and turned into 48 configurations.
